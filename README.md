# lazy_loading

This UliCMS Module provides lazy loading for images and iframes.
Lazy loading means that the media is only then loaded when it is in the view port of the browser.
This increases the site's performance and reduces the data usage.
Without the lazy loading the full page including all images and other media (e.g. Youtube Videos) would be loaded instantly when the user opens the page.
It is compatible with UliCMS 2019.1.4 or later.
